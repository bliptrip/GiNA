A CRAN-provided package is availabe for this tool, but does not support the neural network segmentation capabilities.

# Requirements

# Example Use

Examples of usage can be found in the examples/ subfolder.

# Templates

Templates with size standards for printing are available in the templates/ folder.  Both PDF and Adobe Photoshop formats 
are available, in case the user wants to edit the original templates.  When printing the templates, please make sure you
use the correct print settings to have the size standards correct (print at 100% scale, and measure size standards with
a ruler to make sure they are 1 inch, or 2.54 cm, in width).  There are an assortment of templates available to print
on different size paper formats, along with different spacing of the right and left flanking size standards.
